## Laravel
If you choose to Install Laravel it will create a new Project with composer

## Wordpress
When you choose Wordpress the installer will do a 
fresh install of Wordpress via the WP-CLI tool, you need to install this tool [http://wp-cli.org/](http://wp-cli.org/)

# Install

```npm install -g generator-mh-boilerplate```

# Usage
Jump to your Project Folder and type:
```yo mh-boilerplate```

Yeoman will set all necessary paths and other configs in the config.json

Yeoman will initialize a git repo and will fire `npm run init` to initialize the project

# Important Commands

```

### Development Task

```
Runs webpack-dashboard so you have an overview of your build packages, including the Default Gulp Task with BrowserSync, also webpack is compiling JavaScript and CSS
